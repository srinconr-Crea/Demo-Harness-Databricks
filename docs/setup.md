# Setup guide — demo_harness_databricks

> Guía original del scaffold `agentops-stacks` para un despliegue de tres ambientes. El MVP solo define `dev`; para operar la App actual usa [`operacion.md`](operacion.md). Los pasos de staging/prod de esta guía no están configurados.

End-to-end configuration to get this project deploying. The flow:

1. [Prerequisites](#1-prerequisites) — what your account/workspace need to have first
2. [Unity Catalog setup](#2-unity-catalog-setup) — catalogs, grants, run-as identities
3. [Local development](#3-local-development) — Databricks CLI profiles for dev work
4. [Fill in `databricks.yml`](#4-fill-in-databricksyml) — workspace hosts and run-as
5. [CI/CD credentials](#5-cicd-credentials) — secrets and variables for the chosen platform
6. [First deploy](#6-first-deploy) — validate and deploy to dev

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- Three Databricks workspaces (dev, staging, prod). They can be separate workspaces or environments within one workspace, as long as you can scope catalogs and identities per environment.
- A Unity Catalog metastore attached to each workspace, with permission to create catalogs (or someone who can create them for you).
- An Azure account with permission to create app registrations (for the staging and prod service principals).
- A GitHub repository to push this project to.

## 2. Unity Catalog setup

### 2a. Create catalogs

This project expects one catalog per environment:

| Environment | Default catalog name |
|---|---|
| dev | `demo_harness_databricks_dev` |
| staging | `demo_harness_databricks_staging` |
| prod | `demo_harness_databricks_prod` |

If your org has different catalog naming conventions, override the `catalog` value under each target in `databricks.yml`.

In each workspace, as a metastore or catalog admin:

```sql
CREATE CATALOG IF NOT EXISTS demo_harness_databricks_dev;
CREATE CATALOG IF NOT EXISTS demo_harness_databricks_staging;
CREATE CATALOG IF NOT EXISTS demo_harness_databricks_prod;
```

### 2b. Grant permissions to the deploying identity

The user (for dev) or service principal (for staging/prod) that runs `databricks bundle deploy` needs these grants on the relevant catalog:

```sql
GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG demo_harness_databricks_<env> TO `<identity>`;
GRANT CREATE SCHEMA ON CATALOG demo_harness_databricks_<env> TO `<identity>`;
```

The bundle creates the schema (`demo_harness_databricks`) inside the catalog on first deploy, so the deploying identity also needs to be able to create volumes inside that schema:

```sql
GRANT CREATE VOLUME ON SCHEMA demo_harness_databricks_<env>.demo_harness_databricks TO `<identity>`;
```

`WRITE VOLUME` on the `artifacts` volume is granted automatically to the volume's creator. If you delegate volume creation, grant `WRITE VOLUME` explicitly to whoever runs MLflow.

### 2c. Create service principals (staging + prod)

Production-mode targets in `databricks.yml` use `run_as` to define who the bundle's resources execute as. The default is the deploying user (you), which is fine for getting started but not for real production.

For Azure, create one SP per environment that needs an automated deployer (staging and prod):

**Option A — Azure CLI** (fastest):

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name demo_harness_databricks-staging-sp --skip-assignment
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name demo_harness_databricks-prod-sp --skip-assignment
```

Each command prints `appId`, `password`, and `tenant` — save all three for each SP. You'll use them for `run_as` and CI/CD secrets. `--skip-assignment` avoids granting Azure subscription roles; the SP only needs Databricks workspace access (granted below).

**Option B — Azure portal**: Azure Active Directory → App registrations → New registration. For each app, generate a client secret under Certificates & secrets. Save the Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID, and secret value.

After creating each SP, update `databricks.yml` to reference it in `run_as`:

```yaml
targets:
  staging:
    run_as:
      service_principal_name: <staging-app-id>
  prod:
    run_as:
      service_principal_name: <prod-app-id>
```


### 2d. Grant each SP workspace and `/Shared/` access

After the SPs exist, they need to be wired into the corresponding workspaces. In **each workspace** (staging in the staging workspace, prod in the prod workspace), as a workspace admin:

1. **Add the SP as a workspace service principal.** Admin Settings → Identity and access → Service principals → Add. Use the Application ID (from step 2c) as the SP's identifier. Grant **Workspace access: Can use**.
2. **Grant `/Shared/` write access.** The bundle creates an MLflow experiment under `/Shared/`. The SP needs `Can Manage` on `/Shared/` to create the experiment. Workspace browser → `/Shared/` → ⋮ menu → Permissions → Add → select the SP → `Can Manage`.
3. **Apply the Unity Catalog grants from step 2b**, substituting the SP's Application ID for `<identity>`. Use backticks around the Application ID in SQL:

   ```sql
   GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG demo_harness_databricks_staging TO `<staging-app-id>`;
   GRANT CREATE SCHEMA ON CATALOG demo_harness_databricks_staging TO `<staging-app-id>`;
   ```

Repeat for prod against the prod catalog and prod SP.

## 3. Local development

Configure a Databricks CLI profile for your dev workspace so you can run `databricks bundle validate` and `databricks bundle deploy` from your machine.

```bash
databricks auth login --host https://<your-dev-workspace>.azuredatabricks.net --profile dev
```

This stores credentials in `~/.databrickscfg`. Verify with `databricks current-user me --profile dev`.

Optional: profiles for staging and prod can be configured the same way if you need to inspect or troubleshoot those workspaces locally. Day-to-day deploys to staging and prod go through CI/CD, not your machine.

Sync dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

This generates `uv.lock` (the resolved dependency tree). **Commit `uv.lock` to git** — CI workflows cache against it, and committing it gives deterministic builds across local and CI environments.

`databricks-connect` is a dev dependency — pin it in `pyproject.toml` to match your cluster's runtime version if you'll be running Spark code locally against a remote cluster.

---

## 4. Fill in `databricks.yml`

Open `databricks.yml` and replace the TODO placeholders:

```yaml
targets:
  dev:
    workspace:
      host: https://<your-dev-workspace>.azuredatabricks.net
  staging:
    workspace:
      host: https://<your-staging-workspace>.azuredatabricks.net
  prod:
    workspace:
      host: https://<your-prod-workspace>.azuredatabricks.net
```

If you set up service principals in step 2c, update `run_as` for staging and prod:

```yaml
targets:
  staging:
    run_as:
      service_principal_name: <staging-sp-application-id>
  prod:
    run_as:
      service_principal_name: <prod-sp-application-id>
```

---

## 5. CI/CD credentials

### GitHub Actions

Add the following secrets to the repository. Either via the UI — **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** — or via the GitHub CLI:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `STAGING_AZURE_SP_TENANT_ID` | Tenant ID of the staging SP |
| `STAGING_AZURE_SP_APPLICATION_ID` | Application (client) ID of the staging SP |
| `STAGING_AZURE_SP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret for the staging SP |
| `PROD_AZURE_SP_TENANT_ID` | Tenant ID of the prod SP |
| `PROD_AZURE_SP_APPLICATION_ID` | Application ID of the prod SP |
| `PROD_AZURE_SP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret for the prod SP |

Via `gh` CLI (replace `<org>/<repo>` with your repo):

```bash
gh secret set STAGING_AZURE_SP_TENANT_ID --repo <org>/<repo> --body "<tenant>"
gh secret set STAGING_AZURE_SP_APPLICATION_ID --repo <org>/<repo> --body "<appId>"
gh secret set STAGING_AZURE_SP_CLIENT_SECRET --repo <org>/<repo> --body "<password>"
gh secret set PROD_AZURE_SP_TENANT_ID --repo <org>/<repo> --body "<tenant>"
gh secret set PROD_AZURE_SP_APPLICATION_ID --repo <org>/<repo> --body "<appId>"
gh secret set PROD_AZURE_SP_CLIENT_SECRET --repo <org>/<repo> --body "<password>"
```


Under **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**, enable "Read and write permissions" so jobs can comment on PRs if you extend the workflows to do so.

## 6. First deploy

From your machine, with the dev profile from step 3:

```bash
databricks bundle validate -t dev --profile dev
databricks bundle deploy -t dev --profile dev
```

The first deploy creates the schema and the `artifacts` volume in `demo_harness_databricks_dev`. The MLflow experiment is created under `/Shared/demo_harness_databricks/dev` with the volume as artifact location.

After this, pushes to `main` deploy to staging via CI/CD, and tags matching `v*` deploy to prod.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`token refresh: Refresh token is invalid`** — your CLI profile's OAuth token has expired. Re-run `databricks auth login --profile <name>`.

**`schema does not exist` or `volume does not exist`** — the bundle creates these on deploy. If you destroyed the bundle (`bundle destroy`) and now deploy fails, run `bundle deploy` again; it will recreate them.

**`CREATE SCHEMA permission denied`** — the deploying identity needs `CREATE SCHEMA` on the catalog. See section 2b.

**`run_as.service_principal_name not found`** — the SP must exist in the workspace as a service principal user (not just in the IdP). See section 2c.

**Production mode rejected my deploy** — `mode: production` enforces that the bundle doesn't use user-scoped paths and that `run_as` is set. If you haven't set up service principals yet, change `run_as` to use your username temporarily, or deploy to dev only.

**`Parent directory does not exist: /Shared/...`** — the MLflow experiment is being placed under a workspace folder that doesn't exist. The template uses a flat path (`/Shared/<bundle.name>_<bundle.target>`) to avoid this — if you customized the experiment `name` in `resources/experiment.yml` to a nested path, either create the parent folder in the workspace or revert to a single-level path.

**`The experiment was created with a bad artifact location`** — the `artifact_location` in `resources/experiment.yml` must have an explicit URI scheme (`dbfs:/Volumes/...`), not just `/Volumes/...`. `bundle validate` accepts either; only deploy enforces the scheme.

**CI error: `Unable to verify checksums signature: openpgp: key expired` during Terraform download** — your pinned Databricks CLI in CI is too old for `bundle: engine: direct` and is falling back to the Terraform engine. Bump `cli_version` in `library/template_variables.tmpl` to v0.295.0 or later.
